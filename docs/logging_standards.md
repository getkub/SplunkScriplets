## Minimal logging
- who logged in (account or User ID);
- what they did (type of event/activity);
- when they logged in (date/time);
- where the login occurred (resource/source of the event such as location, IP address, terminal ID or other means of identification); and
- why the login occurred (a link to the specific ticket that necessitated the login).
