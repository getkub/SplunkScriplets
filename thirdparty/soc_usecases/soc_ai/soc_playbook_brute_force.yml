playbook:
  detection_rule: DET_123
  detection_name: "Brute Force Detected"
  severity: "high"
  description: |
    This playbook handles brute force detection alerts originating from Windows systems.
    It outlines correlated data sources, investigation context, queries, and expected outputs.

  indices:
    detection:
      - "windows_index"          # Primary index where the detection originated
    correlation:
      - "windows_index"          # Additional indices to correlate context
      - "active_directory_index"
      - "waf_index"

  investigation:
    context:
      - "Alert triggered due to multiple failed logins from the same user or IP."
      - "Potential brute force attack targeting Windows hosts."
      - "Check if attempts originated from external networks (via WAF)."
    steps:
      - "Identify all unique users involved in the failed login attempts."
      - "Determine source IP addresses associated with these login failures."
      - "Check WAF logs to confirm if these attempts came from external sources."
      - "Correlate with Active Directory events for password lockouts."

  queries:
    - id: query1
      description: "Get failed login counts per user and host from Windows logs."
      search: |
        index=windows_index
        user IN {{user_from_alert}}
        | stats count by user, host
      format: SPL

    - id: query2
      description: "Check if suspicious users attempted access through the WAF."
      search: |
        index=waf_index
        user IN {{user_from_alert}}
        | stats count by user, source_ip
      format: SPL

    - id: query3
      description: "Correlate failed logins with AD lockouts."
      search: |
        index=active_directory_index
        event_type="lockout"
        user IN {{user_from_alert}}
        | stats count by user, host
      format: SPL

  remediation:
    actions:
      - "Block suspicious source IPs if confirmed malicious."
      - "Notify IT team to reset affected user accounts."
      - "Enable account lockout policies for repeated login failures."

  outputs:
    report:
