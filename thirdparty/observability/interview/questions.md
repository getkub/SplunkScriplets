| Feature                 | Monitoring                                 | Observability                                   |
|---|---|---|
| Focus                    | Pre-defined metrics and events             | Internal system state and behavior               |
| Proactive vs Reactive     | Primarily reactive                          | Can be both proactive and reactive                |
| Data Used                 | Specific data points (metrics)               | Metrics, logs, and traces                         |
| Goal                     | Situational awareness                        | Deep understanding of system behavior             |
| Analogy                  | Car dashboard with gauges                  | Mechanic's toolkit with diagnostic capabilities |
