## Interview Questions for Principal Observability Engineer (AWS Focus)

**Observability Concepts and Tools:**

1. **Deep Dive on Metrics:**
* Explain the difference between Cardinality and Dimensionality in metrics. How do you handle high cardinality metrics in an AWS environment?

    - **Cardinality**: Imagine you have a dataset of customer transactions, and one of the dimensions is "Product ID." Each transaction records the product that a customer purchased. Now, if you have a wide range of products in your inventory, each with a unique ID, the cardinality of the "Product ID" dimension would be high. For instance, if you have 10,000 unique products, the cardinality of this dimension would be 10,000.

        Can be reduced by 
        - Sampling
        - aggregating data
        - Hashing

    - **Dimension**: Consider a dataset tracking website traffic. You may have dimensions such as "Date," "Page URL," "Referrer," "Device Type," "Browser," and "Country." Each of these dimensions adds to the overall dimensionality of your dataset. So if you have these six dimensions, your dataset's dimensionality would be 6.

        Can be reduced by 
        - Tags

* Describe different types of aggregations used for metrics (e.g., sum, count, average) and when you would use each. 
* How can you leverage Amazon CloudWatch metrics for anomaly detection?

2. **Distributed Tracing Expertise:**
    * Explain the concept of distributed tracing and its benefits for troubleshooting complex microservices architectures.
    * Walk us through the process of implementing distributed tracing with a tool like AWS X-Ray. 
    * How can you use distributed tracing data to identify performance bottlenecks in an application?

3. **OpenTelemetry Knowledge:**
    * Describe your experience with the OpenTelemetry project. 
    * Explain the benefits of using OpenTelemetry for instrumenting applications compared to vendor-specific solutions.
    * How would you approach migrating an existing monitoring setup to use OpenTelemetry with AWS services?

**AWS Observability and Scalability:**

4. **Building and Running Large-Scale Systems on AWS:**
    * Describe your experience architecting and deploying highly scalable distributed systems on AWS. 
    * How do you leverage AWS services like Auto Scaling Groups and CloudWatch alarms for proactive capacity management?
    * Discuss strategies for optimizing the cost-efficiency of your observability solution on AWS.

5. **Troubleshooting Platforms on AWS:**
    * Walk us through your approach to troubleshooting a performance issue in a complex AWS-based application. 
    * Which AWS tools and services would you utilize for gathering diagnostic data and pinpointing the root cause?
    * Describe a situation where you used observability data to identify and resolve a critical production incident on AWS.

**Bonus Questions:**

* Discuss your experience with integrating observability data with other tools like dashboards (e.g., Grafana) or alerting systems (e.g., PagerDuty).
* How would you approach building a disaster recovery plan for your observability infrastructure on AWS?
* Share your thoughts on emerging trends in observability and how they might impact your approach in the future.
