***If using Conf files***
If you are using "conf" files You could do completely avoid eval-CASE itself based based on lookup file with normal lookup and/or wildcard lookup (MATCH_TYPE)

But the greatest problem is [precedence/sequence order of search-time Operations][1]
Lookups come after the Calculated/aliasing operations sequence and hence  you **CANNOT** use the values extracted using LOOKUP for later Evaluations as EVAL executes **before** LOOKUP 

I had put a feature request to have SPLUNK to have double iteration with  LOOKUP2 or EVAL2 option , so these issues can be sorted. I find it very hard to enrich data from lookup and then do eval on that 


***If using UI search ***
There is NO match option, but you can design your lookup in a clever manner.  For example, you can have an extra column in your csv to have group or category. So each type of granular items can be attached to a group and can output them
